(1) Run control experiments for DMS/DMC on Mturk (20 participants each: 100 trials per participant)

(2) Run psychophysics room experiments for DMS

(3) Run psychophysics room + generalization experiments for DMC

(4) Run up-down and left-right experiments for DMC

(5) Build modeling framework to compare 'naive RL' against 'strategic' learning

Paper outline:

Cognitive behavior in humans doesn't translate directly to animal models.
